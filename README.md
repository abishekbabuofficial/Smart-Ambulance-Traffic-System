# Smart Ambulance Traffic System (SATS) ðŸš‘  

This repository contains the implementation of the **Smart Ambulance Traffic System (SATS)** project, designed to prioritize emergency vehicles and reduce delays in urban traffic using AI-driven systems. The project integrates two key components:  

## Features  
1. **YOLOv8 Ambulance Detection Model:**  
   - Detects ambulances in real-time from live traffic footage using the YOLOv8 algorithm.  
   - Trained on a diverse dataset of ambulance images for high accuracy.
   - For reference visit: https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/ 

2. **Siren Detection Model:**  
   - Classifies audio inputs to detect ambulance sirens amidst urban noise.  
   - Built with TensorFlow and Librosa for audio processing and deep learning.
   - This uses a pre processing Step called MFCC - Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients.
